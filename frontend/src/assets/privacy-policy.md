## General scope

This policy covers personally identifiable information collected or
stored by Bestiary Builder on its servers in relation to the service it
provides.

Consistent with its Data Retention Policy, Bestiary Builder collects and
retains the least amount of personally identifiable information needed to
fulfil the site's operational needs.

## The public and collaborative nature of the Wiki

All content on Bestiary Builder are collaboratively developed by
its users using the MediaWiki software. Anyone with Internet access (and
not otherwise restricted from doing so) may edit the publicly editable
pages of these sites with or without logging in as a registered user. By
doing this, editors create a published document, and a public record of
every word added, subtracted, or changed. This is a public act, and
editors are identified publicly as the author of such changes. All
contributions made to an article, and all publicly available information
about those contributions, are irrevocably licensed and may be freely
copied, quoted, reused and adapted by third parties with few
restrictions.

## Activities on Bestiary Builder

In general, this Policy only applies to private information stored or
held by Bestiary Builder which is not publicly available.

Interactions with articles not covered by this Policy include, but are
not limited to, aspects of browsing and editing pages, use of the wiki
"email user" function, and subscribing and posting to Bestiary Builder hosted email lists.

These interactions may reveal a contributor's IP address, and possibly other personal information,
indiscriminately to the general public, or to specific groups of
volunteers acting independently of Bestiary Builder.

Users may also interact with one another outside of Bestiary Builder,
via email, IRC or other chat, or independent websites, and should
assess the risks involved, and their personal need for privacy, before
using these methods of communication.

## User accounts and authorship

Bestiary Builder does require editors to register with the wiki.
Users that do register are identified by their chosen username. Users
select a password, which is confidential and used to verify the
integrity of their account. Except insofar as it may be required by law,
no person should disclose, or knowingly expose, either user passwords
and/or cookies generated to identify a user. Once created, user accounts
will not be removed.

## Purpose of the collection of private information

Bestiary Builder limits the collection of personally
identifiable user data to purposes which serve the well-being of its
pages, including but not limited to the following:

To enhance the public accountability of the wiki. Bestiary Builder
recognizes that any system that is open enough to allow the
greatest possible participation of the general public will also be
vulnerable to certain kinds of abuse and counterproductive behavior.
Bestiary Builder and its community have established a number of
mechanisms to prevent or remedy abusive activities. For example, when
investigating abuse on the wiki, including the suspected use of
malicious “sockpuppets” (duplicate accounts), vandalism, harassment of
other users, or disruptive behavior, the IP addresses of users (derived
either from those logs or from records in the database) may be used to
identify the source(s) of the abusive behavior. This information may be
shared by users with administrative authority who are charged by the
community to protect the wiki

To provide site statistics. Bestiary Builder statistically
samples raw log data from users' visits. These logs are used to produce
the site statistics pages; the raw log data is not made public.

To solve technical problems. Log data may be examined by developers in
the course of solving technical problems and in tracking down
badly-behaved web spiders that overwhelm the site.

## Details of data retention

### IP and other technical information

When a visitor requests or reads a page, no more information is
collected than is typically collected by web sites. Bestiary Builder
may keep raw logs of such transactions, but these will not be
published or used to track legitimate users.

<!-- -->

When a page is edited by a logged-in editor, the server confidentially
stores related IP information for a limited period of time.

### Cookies

The sites set a temporary session cookie on a visitor's computer
whenever a page is visited. Readers who do not intend to log in or edit
may deny this cookie; it will be deleted at the end of the browser's
session. More cookies may be set when one logs in to maintain logged-in
status. If one saves a user name or password in one's browser, that
information will be saved for up to 30 days, and this information will
be resent to the server on every visit to the site. Contributors using a
public machine who do not wish to show their username to future users of
the machine should clear these cookies after use.

### Page history

Edits or other contributions to a page, user pages and talk pages are
generally retained forever. Removing text from a page does not
permanently delete it. Normally, in pages, anyone can look at a previous
version of an article and see what was there. Even if an article is
"deleted", a user entrusted with higher level of access may still see
what was removed from public view. Information can be permanently
deleted by individuals with access to Bestiary Builder servers,
but aside from the rare circumstance when Bestiary Builder is
required to delete editing-history material in response to a court order
or equivalent legal process, there is no guarantee any permanent
deletion will happen.

### User contribution

User contributions are also aggregated and publicly available. User
contributions are aggregated according to their registration and login
status. Data on user contributions, such as the times at which users
edited and the number of edits they have made, are publicly available
via user contributions lists, and in aggregated forms published by other
users.

#### Reading pages

No more information on users and other visitors reading pages is
collected than is typically collected in server logs by web sites. Aside
from the above raw log data collected for general purposes, page visits
do not expose a visitor's identity publicly. Sampled raw log data may
include the IP address of any user, but it is not reproduced publicly.

#### Editing pages

Edits to pages are identified with the username or network IP address of
the editor, and editing history is aggregated by author in a
contribution list. Such information will be available permanently on the
page.

Logged in registered users:

Logged in users do not expose their IP address to the public except in
cases of abuse, including vandalism of a wiki page by the user or by
another user with the same IP address. A user's IP address is stored on
the wiki servers for a period of time, during which it can be seen by
server administrators and by users who have been granted CheckUser
access.

IP address information, and its connection to any usernames that share
it, may be released under certain circumstances (see below).

Editors using a company mail server from home or telecommuting over a
DSL or cable Internet connection, are likely to be easy to identify by
their IP address; in which case it may be easy to cross-identify all
contributions to various pages made by that IP. Using a username is a
better way of preserving privacy in this situation.

Unlogged-in registered users and unregistered users:

Editors who have not logged in may be identified by network IP address.
Depending on one's connection, this IP address may be traceable to a
large Internet service provider or more specifically to a school, place
of business or home. It may be possible to use this information in
combination with other information, including editing style and
preferences, to identify an author completely.

#### Discussions

On wiki discussion pages:

Any editable page can theoretically be the location of a discussion. In
general, discussions on Bestiary Builder pages occur on user
talk pages (associated with particular users), on article talk pages
(associated with particular articles) or in pages specially designated
to function as forums (e.g., the Staff Lounge). Privacy expectations
apply to discussion pages in the same way as they do elsewhere.

Via email:

Users are not required to list an email address when registering. Users
who provide a valid email address can enable other logged-in users to
send email to them through the wiki. When receiving an email from other
users through this system, one's email address is not revealed to them.
When choosing to send an email to other users, one's email is displayed
as the sender.

The email address put into one's user preferences may be used by Bestiary Builder
for communication. Users whose accounts do not have
a valid email address will not be able to reset their password if it is
lost. In such a situation, however, users may be able to contact one of
the Bestiary Builder server administrators to enter a new e-mail
address. A user can remove the account's email address from his
preferences at any time to prevent it from being used. Private
correspondence between users may be saved at those users' discretion and
is not subject to Bestiary Builder policy.

On IRC:

IRC channels are not officially part of the Bestiary Builder and
are not operated on Bestiary Builder controlled servers. The IP
address of users who chat over such a service may be exposed to other
participants. IRC users' privacy on each channel can only be protected
according to the policies of the respective service and channel.
Different channels have different policies on whether logs may be
published.

## Access to and release of personally identifiable information

Access:

Pages are developed by volunteer contributors. Some dedicated users are
chosen by the community to be given privileged access. For example,
users who actively patrol edits and clean up vandalism may be promoted
with Rollback privileges or Sysop status. User group rights and group
members are reachable from the
[Special:ListGroupRights](Special:ListGroupRights "wikilink") page.

Other users who may have access to private identifiable information
include, but are not limited to, users who have access to the CheckUser
and Oversight functions, Bestiary Builder employees, and
contractors and agents employed by the Bestiary Builder, and
developers and others with high levels of server access.

Access to and publication of this information is governed by the Access
to nonpublic data policy, as well as specific policies covering some of
the functions in question. Sharing information with other privileged
users is not considered "distribution."

Release: Policy on Release of Data

It is the policy of Bestiary Builder that personally
identifiable data collected in the server logs, or through records in
the database via the CheckUser feature, or through other
non-publicly-available methods, may be released by Bestiary Builder admins or staff, in any of the following situations:

1.  In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law
    enforcement,
2.  With permission of the affected user,
3.  When necessary for investigation of abuse complaints,
4.  Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider
    or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or resolve
    technical issues,
5.  Where the user has been vandalizing articles or persistently
    behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to a service
    provider, carrier, or other third-party entity to assist in the
    targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a
    complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers,
6.  Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or
    safety of Bestiary Builder, its users or the public.

Except as described above, Bestiary Builder policy does not
permit distribution of personally identifiable information under any
circumstances.

Third-party access and notifying registered users when receiving legal
process:

As a general principle, the access to, and retention of, personally
identifiable data in all pages should be minimal and should be used only
internally to serve the well-being of the pages. Occasionally, however,
Bestiary Builder may receive a subpoena or other compulsory
request from a law-enforcement agency or a court or equivalent
government body that requests the disclosure of information about a
registered user, and may be compelled by law to comply with the request.
In the event of such a legally compulsory request, Bestiary Builder will attempt to notify the affected user within three business days
after the arrival of such subpoena by sending a notice by email to the
email address (if any) that the affected user has listed in his or her
user preferences.

Bestiary Builder cannot advise a user receiving such a
notification regarding the law or an appropriate response to a subpoena.
Bestiary Builder does note, however, that such users may have
the legal right to resist or limit that information in court by filing a
motion to quash the subpoena. Users who wish to oppose a subpoena or
other compulsory request should seek legal advice concerning applicable
rights and procedures that may be available.

If Bestiary Builder receives a court-filed motion to quash or
otherwise limit the subpoena as a result of action by a user or their
lawyer, Bestiary Builder will not disclose the requested
information until it receives an order from the court to do so.

Registered users are not required to provide an email address. However,
when an affected registered user does not provide an email address, Bestiary Builder will not be able to notify the affected user in
private email messages when it receives requests from law enforcement to
disclose personally identifiable information about the user.

## Google Analytics Usage

Bestiary Builder makes use of Google Analytics, which uses
cookies and collects information. Certain information such as your
browser, and your IP address may be sent to Google Analytics but this
information is always anonymized so that we don’t know which specific
visitors are associated with what browser and we do not have access to
any IP information in Google Analytics. Analytics may use several
cookies including cookies stored for very long periods in order to
determine if you have visited the site before, but Analytics never
associates any identifiable information with your visit. So we may know
many people visit a particular page, but we won’t know specifically who
read it. For more information, please review the information on the
following link:

-   [Google Privacy &
    Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)

To opt out of being counted in Google Analytics, you can install a
[browser add on made by
Google](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## Disclaimer

Bestiary Builder believes that maintaining and preserving the
privacy of user data is an important value. This Privacy Policy,
together with other policies, resolutions, and actions by Bestiary Builder, represents a committed effort to safeguard the security
of the limited user information that is collected and retained on our
servers. Nevertheless, Bestiary Builder cannot guarantee that
user information will remain private. We acknowledge that, in spite of
our committed effort to protect private user information, determined
individuals may still develop data-mining and other methods to uncover
such information and disclose it. For this reason, Bestiary Builder can make no guarantee against unauthorized access to information
provided in the course of participating in Bestiary Builder
pages or related communities.
