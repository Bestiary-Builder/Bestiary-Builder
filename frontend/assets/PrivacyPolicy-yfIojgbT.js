This policy covers personally identifiable information collected or
stored by Bestiary Builder on its servers in relation to the service it
provides.

Consistent with its Data Retention Policy, Bestiary Builder collects and
retains the least amount of personally identifiable information needed to
fulfil the site's operational needs.

## Activities on Bestiary Builder

In general, this Policy only applies to private information stored or
held by Bestiary Builder which is not publicly available.

The interactions with Bestiary Builder may reveal a user's account name
and other publicly available discord account details,
indiscriminately to the general public.

Users may also interact with one another outside of Bestiary Builder,
via email, IRC or other chat, or independent websites, and should
assess the risks involved, and their personal need for privacy, before
using these methods of communication.

## User accounts and authorship

Bestiary Builder does require editors to register to edit or create content.
Registered users are identified by their chosen username, and avatar.
Except insofar as it may be required by law, no person should disclose,
or knowingly expose, either user passwords and/or cookies generated to identify a user.
Once created, user accounts will not be removed from Bestiary Builder.

## Purpose of the collection of private information

Bestiary Builder limits the collection of personally
identifiable user data to purposes which serve the well-being of its
site, including but not limited to the following:

To enhance the public accountability of the site. Bestiary Builder
recognizes that any system that is open enough to allow the
creation end editing of content by the general public will also be
vulnerable to certain kinds of abuse and counterproductive behavior.
Bestiary Builder have established a number of
mechanisms to prevent or remedy abusive activities. For example, when
investigating abuse on the site, including the suspected use of
malicious “sockpuppets” (duplicate accounts), vandalism, harassment of
other users, or disruptive behavior, the IP addresses of users (derived
either from those logs or from records in the database) may be used to
identify the source(s) of the abusive behavior. This information may be
shared by persons which may include, but are not limited to,
Bestiary Builder employees, and contractors and agents employed by Bestiary Builder, and
developers and others with high levels of server access.

To provide site statistics. Bestiary Builder statistically
samples raw log data from users' visits. These logs are used to produce
the site statistics pages; the raw log data is not made public.

To solve technical problems. Log data may be examined by developers in
the course of solving technical problems and in tracking down
badly-behaved web spiders that overwhelm the site.

## Details of data retention

### IP and other technical information

When a visitor requests or reads a page, no more information is
collected than is typically collected by web sites. Bestiary Builder
may keep raw logs of such transactions, but these will not be
published or used to track legitimate users.

### Personally identifiable information

The personally identifiable information which may be collected by Bestiary Builder includes
the user's email, username, avatar and ip address, as provided upon logging in to the site.

### User contribution

User contributions may be aggregated and publicly available. User
contributions are aggregated according to their login and selected status.
Data on user contributions, such as the content the user added or edited, the times at which users
edited, are publicly available on the site, unless otherwise marked private by the user.

Content marked as private will not be publicly available, and will therefore only be
accesible to the users specifically given access, or some persons with high levels of server access.

### Cookies

The site set a user cookie on a visitor's computer whenever the visitor logs in to
maintain logged-in status. Contributors using a public machine who do not wish to
be stay logged in for future users ofthe machine should clear this cookie after use.

## Access to and release of personally identifiable information

Some persons with high levels of server access may have access to private
personally identifiable information, which may include, but are not limited to,
Bestiary Builder employees, and contractors and agents employed by Bestiary Builder, and
developers and others with high levels of server access.

Access to and publication of this information is governed by the Access
to nonpublic data policy, as well as specific policies covering some of
the functions in question. Sharing information with other privileged
users is not considered "distribution".

### Release: Policy on Release of Data

It is the policy of Bestiary Builder that personally
identifiable data collected in the server logs, or through records in
the database, may be released by Bestiary Builder admins or staff, in any of the following situations:

1.  In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law
    enforcement,
2.  With permission of the affected user,
3.  When necessary for investigation of abuse complaints,
4.  Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider
    or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or resolve
    technical issues,
5.  Where the user has been persistently behaving in a disruptive way,
    data may be released to a service provider, carrier, or other
    third-party entity to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to
    assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers,
6.  Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or
    safety of Bestiary Builder, its users or the public.

Except as described above, Bestiary Builder policy does not
permit distribution of personally identifiable information under any
circumstances.

Third-party access and notifying registered users when receiving legal
process:

As a general principle, the access to, and retention of, personally
identifiable data in all pages should be minimal and should be used only
internally to serve the well-being of the pages. Occasionally, however,
Bestiary Builder may receive a subpoena or other compulsory
request from a law-enforcement agency or a court or equivalent
government body that requests the disclosure of information about a
registered user, and may be compelled by law to comply with the request.
In the event of such a legally compulsory request, Bestiary Builder will attempt
to notify the affected user within three business days
after the arrival of such subpoena by sending a notice by email to the
email address (if any) that the affected user has connected to their account.

Bestiary Builder cannot advise a user receiving such a
notification regarding the law or an appropriate response to a subpoena.
Bestiary Builder does note, however, that such users may have
the legal right to resist or limit that information in court by filing a
motion to quash the subpoena. Users who wish to oppose a subpoena or
other compulsory request should seek legal advice concerning applicable
rights and procedures that may be available.

If Bestiary Builder receives a court-filed motion to quash or
otherwise limit the subpoena as a result of action by a user or their
lawyer, Bestiary Builder will not disclose the requested
information until it receives an order from the court to do so.

## Google Analytics Usage

Bestiary Builder makes use of Google Analytics, which uses
cookies and collects information. Certain information such as your
browser, and your IP address may be sent to Google Analytics but this
information is always anonymized so that we don’t know which specific
visitors are associated with what browser and we do not have access to
any IP information in Google Analytics. Analytics may use several
cookies including cookies stored for very long periods in order to
determine if you have visited the site before, but Analytics never
associates any identifiable information with your visit. So we may know
many people visit a particular page, but we won’t know specifically who
read it. For more information, please review the information on the
following link:

-   [Google Privacy &
    Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)

To opt out of being counted in Google Analytics, you can install a
[browser add on made by
Google](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
